# 🐱🐶 SVM Cat vs Dog Classifier

This is a simple machine learning project using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of **cats** and **dogs**.

## 📂 Dataset
- [Cats and Dogs Filtered Dataset (Google-hosted)](https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip)
- 1000 total images used (500 cats + 500 dogs)
- Images resized to 64x64 and converted to grayscale

## 🧠 Model
- Model: `SVC(kernel='linear')` from scikit-learn
- Features: Flattened grayscale images
- Split: 80% train / 20% test

## 🔍 Accuracy
Achieved high accuracy on test set using SVM
